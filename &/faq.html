											Employee Retention Credit (ERC) is a stimulus program
											designed to help businesses that were able to retain their
											employees during the Covid-19 pandemic. Established by the
											CARES Act, it is a refundable tax credit – a grant, not a
											loan – that you can claim for your business. The ERC is
											available to both small and mid-sized businesses. It is
											based on qualified wages and healthcare paid to employees.
